### Good day there visitor! :wave:

And as of 2020 I am in my third year in college and I'm majoring in Software Technologies.

I aspire to be a professional programmer someday but more importantly I want to contribute to the open-source world.

I'm currently dual-booting Windows 10 and Pop! OS which is a Linux distro :penguin:

:coffee: **Facts about me:**
- Coffee and tea lover.
- I only learned to code when I started college, my first language was C++ but I like to work on Java.
- I was a STEM student in my senior high school.
