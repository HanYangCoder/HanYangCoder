### Good day there visitor! :wave:

I'm **Hans Christian Herrera** and I am an Information Technology student in West Visayas State University.
And as of 2020 I am in my third year in college and I'm majoring in Software Technologies.

:round_pushpin: I was born and currently living here in **Iloilo City, Philippines**.

I aspire to be a professional programmer someday but more importantly I want to contribute to the open-source world. 
I've just started out using GitHub and I'm in the process of learning it along with Git. Though currently my machine is a 
Windows 10 OS, I do wanna try out Linux someday, specifically the Ubuntu distro. :penguin:


:computer: **Here are some Languages/Frameworks/Development skills I know and some that I'm in the process of learning:**
- Java
- C++
- C#
- HTML/CSS
- PHP
- MySQL
- Arduino
- Flutter and Dart


:books: **My projects:**
- Currently I don't have one in mind yet but I'll keep this updated!


:coffee: **Facts about me:**
- I'm a coffee and tea lover.
- I only learned to code when I started college, my first language was C++ but I like to work on Java.
- I was a STEM student in my senior high school.
- I am the eldest sibling and I have two other younger siblings.
- Joining the IT world wasn't my first choice, nor was it in any of my choices, though I love where I am right now.
